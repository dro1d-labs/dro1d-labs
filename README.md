Dro1d Labs

Applied iOS Security • Privacy Engineering • Secure Tooling

Dro1d Labs builds modern, developer-friendly security components for iOS and macOS.
Our work focuses on device integrity, secure storage, on-device classification, and high-performance privacy systems.

We publish open-source tooling, research notes, and practical modules designed for real apps under real threat conditions.

⸻

Core Focus Areas
	•	Device Integrity & Anti-Tampering
Jailbreak detection, runtime integrity, hooking defense, sandbox verification.
	•	Secure Storage & Cryptography
AES-256 vaults, secure key management, tamper-aware persistence.
	•	On-Device Privacy Systems
Photo scanning engines, redaction pipelines, edge-only inference.
	•	Operational Stealth & Safety Mechanisms
Panic workflows, emergency lockouts, UI-level privacy defences.

📚 osx-and-ios-security (Research Fork)

Curated reference repository of iOS/macOS security techniques, tooling, and defensive patterns.
Regularly updated with annotated notes and real-world applicability review.

⸻

Guiding Principles
	•	100% On-Device
No telemetry, no user tracking, no external pipelines.
	•	Open Security
Clear threat models, transparent architecture notes, practical implementation examples.
	•	Operational Reliability
Performance-conscious designs suitable for production apps.

⸻

Roadmap (Early 2026)
	•	Public release: TamperKit Core
	•	VaultKit encrypted blob store
	•	Open-source threat model templates
	•	iOS secure UI patterns library
	•	Reference implementations for developers
